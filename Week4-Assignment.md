# 🔄 Week 4: Deep Dive into MERN Stack Integration

## 🚀 Objective
Build a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application that demonstrates seamless integration between front-end and back-end components, including database operations, API communication, and state management.

## 📂 Tasks

### Task 1: Project Setup
- Set up a project with a clear directory structure for both client and server
- Configure MongoDB connection using Mongoose
- Set up Express.js server with necessary middleware
- Create a React front-end using Vite and configure proxy for API calls
- Implement environment variables for configuration management

### Task 2: Back-End Development
- Design and implement a RESTful API for a blog application with the following endpoints:
  - `GET /api/posts`: Get all blog posts
  - `GET /api/posts/:id`: Get a specific blog post
  - `POST /api/posts`: Create a new blog post
  - `PUT /api/posts/:id`: Update an existing blog post
  - `DELETE /api/posts/:id`: Delete a blog post
  - `GET /api/categories`: Get all categories
  - `POST /api/categories`: Create a new category
- Create Mongoose models for `Post` and `Category` with proper relationships
- Implement input validation using a library like Joi or express-validator
- Add error handling middleware for API routes

### Task 3: Front-End Development
- Create React components for:
  - Post list view
  - Single post view
  - Create/edit post form
  - Navigation and layout
- Implement React Router for navigation between different views
- Use React hooks for state management (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- Create a custom hook for API calls

### Task 4: Integration and Data Flow
- Implement API service in React to communicate with the back-end
- Set up state management for posts and categories
- Create forms with proper validation for creating and editing posts
- Implement optimistic UI updates for better user experience
- Handle loading and error states for API calls

### Task 5: Advanced Features
- Add user authentication (registration, login, protected routes)
- Implement image uploads for blog post featured images
- Add pagination for the post list
- Implement searching and filtering functionality
- Add comments feature for blog posts

## 🧪 Expected Outcome
- A fully functional MERN stack blog application
- Proper integration between MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js
- Clean code organization with separation of concerns
- Responsive UI with good user experience
- Implementation of at least one advanced feature

## 🛠️ Setup
1. Make sure you have Node.js (v18+) and MongoDB installed
2. Clone the starter code repository
3. Install server dependencies:
   ```
